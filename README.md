SemiBoombox is a mod that allows players to stream songs directly from their character. With networked audio playback, everyone in the lobby running the mod can hear the song being played. The user-friendly interface lets you control playback easily using an in-game GUI.

### Features
- **Networked Audio Playback:**  
  When a song is played, all players in the lobby hear it, thanks to Photon-based synchronization.
  
- **Easy-to-Use GUI:**  
  Press **X** to open the SemiBoombox interface, where you can:
  - Paste a valid YouTube URL.
  - Adjust the volume.
  - Control playback with **Play**, **Stop**, and **Close** buttons.
  
- **Dynamic Song Caching:**  
  Downloaded songs are cached for reuse, ensuring smooth playback without unnecessary re-downloads. (In memory, not on disk!)

### Disclaimer
On the first run, SemiBoombox requires a short initialization period to download two dependencies: **yt-dlp** and **ffmpeg**. This setup process may take a few moments, but subsequent launches will start up normally without delay.
